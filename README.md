# UIS-assets
This repository contains python scripts to analyze University of Illinois System assets invested in companies that profit from the extraction, transportation, or combustion of coal, petroleum, or natural gas.

## Background

The University of Illinois System has over $3.9 Billion assets under management (note that this asset pool is independent of the University of Illinois Foundationâ€™s (UIF) Endowment, which has $2.2+ Billion assets under management). Of these assets, $2.8+ Billion are housed in the Operating Pool. The Operating Pool **"includes cash from state appropriations, tuition and fees, student loan funds, grants, self-insurance programs, and hospital and auxiliary services."** [UIS Annual Report pg. 9]
